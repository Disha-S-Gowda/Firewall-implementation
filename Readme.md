In this network security project, I successfully implemented various firewall functionalities using the SEED Labs â€“ Firewall Exploration Lab as a guide. The project was divided into multiple tasks, each focusing on different aspects of firewall configuration and management.

Task 1 involved implementing a simple firewall using kernel modules and Netfilter. I successfully created a kernel module and integrated it into the packet processing path within the kernel using Netfilter, allowing me to manipulate packets efficiently.

In Task 2, I experimented with stateless firewall rules using iptables. I configured rules to protect the router, internal network, and internal servers, ensuring secure communication while blocking unauthorized access.

Task 3 introduced connection tracking and stateful firewall configurations. By leveraging conntrack, I gained insights into how firewalls can maintain context-awareness for TCP, UDP, and ICMP connections, enhancing network security.

Task 4 focused on limiting network traffic using the iptables limit module. I successfully restricted packet flow from specific sources, managing network traffic effectively.

Finally, in Task 5, I explored load balancing using iptables, distributing UDP traffic among multiple servers. By configuring rules for load balancing, I learned to optimize network resources and improve performance.

Throughout the project, I encountered challenges such as understanding iptables commands and designing effective firewall rules. However, through careful experimentation and analysis, I overcame these obstacles and gained a comprehensive understanding of firewall concepts and their practical implementation for network security.
